Project is build, will give you some instruction, please wait for your queries ask them when i'm done 

project is imported and successfully build. I also generated apk file.

you will find them in DESKTOP/projectname/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
app-debug.apk is the apk file

i also opened the apk folder for one of the project

we had sent 2 files for reference with the project

Android Project Structure
this file will help with the Android Studio file structure. for eg: where are the java files,layout files,images etc

Restfull Api
this file will help you with how android is connected with the database and how database calls are made

i will start with the guild lines about how to study a project.

Never jump into the Code Directly. Start with understanding the Workflow of the App.
and how to do  it


for eg: consider login page: u will find 2 textboxes and a button, so when u click on the button the code checks for the validation and once the validations are right then it calls the function for database calls and according to the reply it handles whether to proceed or no

so understand the flow in detail as if you have developed the project

now after understanding the workflow of the system if you jump into the code, you can very easily relate the code even if u dont understand the syntax

so to start with copy paste these apk files in your phone and install them from your phone
and you are good to go

1. Connect Your Phone to PC using USB Cable
2. Now in your Phone, you get notification that your phone is connected to USB.
3. Now Click on that notification and Change the mode to File Transfer.
4. Now your phone would show up in the MyComputer.
5. Now open your phones drive and copy it into internal Memory
6. Using any File Manager app, locate the apk and install
